THIS IS CRUCIAL !\r\nNext proceed to the NPC Akara and talk to her, she will get you started on the first quest.\r\n\r\nThings you SHOULD DO:\r\n1. Pick up all the waypoint scrolls as you explore each new area. There is a list of all of them sorted by ACT in the journal.\r\n2. Do the quests in order.\r\n3. Read the quest information and journal entry for each quest.\r\n4. Follow the quest instructions.\r\n5. Seek out a party with players of a similar level. The amount of experience/kill will not be as good but team work and survival will make it worthwhile. And you may learn a thing or two from your team mates.\r\n6. Read the battle log and see what is going on, what happened, what worked, what did not.\r\n\r\nThings you SHOULD NOT DO:\r\n1. Beg for gear or gold.\r\n2. Attack NPC's in Rogue Camp or the other towns.\r\n3. Shout a lot of questions or comments, no one wants to hear it, trust me.\r\nIf you are stuck and you have followed the instructions above, use the tell chat channel and ask someone your question directly, you are more likely to get an answer that way. If you have not read the basic information and followed instructions, don't expect a friendly reply.\r\n4. Try to kill, spell harass, pick pocket, disarm, or otherwise be unfriendly to other players. If you want to play player vs. player get consent from the other player first. Otherwise go somewhere else. You have lots of choices for this kind of predatory playing on other servers, Diablo-NWN is not the place for it.\r\n5. Try to steal the drop from another player. The monster spawner/killer gets the right to take the drop. Stay away from the remains if you did not spawn it and kill it.\r\n\r\nGood Luck, \r\nhave fun and good hunting.\r\n\r\np.s.
