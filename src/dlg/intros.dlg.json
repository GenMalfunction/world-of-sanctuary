            "0": "3rd Day of Montaht, Lauds\n\nMy dearest Elora\n\nIt's been ten long years since you were taken from Anya and me. In my mind's eye, I still see your beautiful face and remember the happier days of our time together. It comforts me to write and think that, somehow, you are reading this yourself. It may not be long before I join you in the afterlife.\n\nOur peoples time here in Harrogath is drawing to an end. Recently, ouor seer, Caldra, has been afflicted with terrifying visions of our doom. Last night the whole village awoke to her screams. When I reached Caldra's cottage, our daughter, Anya, was already there comforting her. During the night, the seer's raven hair had turned stark white. She was delirious when I entered the room, howling senselessly and tearing out her hair in bloody clumps.\n\nIt took us some time to calm her-but even then, she seemed only a shadow of her former self. She wouldn't respond to any of us directly, instead staring into some unseen world beyond our own. The healer, Malah, came, but her attempts to cure Caldra were futile. Our tortured seer was not sick of body-she had quite clearly gone mad.\n\n4th Day of Montaht, Sext\n\nThis morning as the dawn came, the other Elders and I held a vigil over Caldra's comatose form, praying to the Ancients for guidance. Then, just as suddenly as it began, her madness broke, or so it seemed. She sat straight up in bed, thin strands of her once beautiful hair draping over her nightgown-her eyes seemed to glow with a feverish inner light. By the Ancients, she looked older than any Elder there.\n\nShe gazed slowly around the room, looking at each of us in turn. With a slight, almost mocking smirk, she whispered in a ragged voice, \"Baal comes...and destruction follows him like a storm.\" She then sank back into bed and with a shudder, breathed her last. By the gods, Elora, as long as I draw breath, I will never forget her terrible portent.\n\n5th day of Montaht, Vespers\n\nIf Caldras's prophetic words were not enough to move Qual-Kehk and his men to take up arms, then the black clouds of smoke rising in the south surely proved to be! We surmised that a great army was marching towards us, led by none other than Baal, the Lord of Destruction. Our worst fears were confirmed when we lost all contact with our capital, Sescheron.\n\nI fear the worst, but I put my faith in Qual-Kehk. He's always defended us against those who would attempt to assault sacred Mt. Arreat. It's likely that Sescheron was taken by surprise-may the Ancients watch over them-but we, the sons of Harrogath, remain vigilant. The ancient barricades and watchtowers built for this day stand ready, as they always have.\n\nThe old prophecies speak of a dark day when destruction will wash over us like a torrent of blood and fire, leaving nothing but the ashes of our people in its wake. As I look south towards the darkening skies, I know that the day of doom had finally come.\n\n7th Day of Montaht, Matins\n\nIt seems that I am not the only one who cannot sleep. Qual-Kehk readies his men even now, as I ready myself. This morning, I shall propose that we perform one of the long-forbidden Druidic spells of warding. As Elders we along are capable of summoning such tremendous energies. Though the ward may drain us of vital magical reserves, if our land is to be saved, we will do what we must.\n\nOur people once considers the Druids brethren-but after the terrible Mage Wars, the Druids were exiled to the harsh wilds beyond our homeland. Since then, our Elders have kept their fearsome Druidic powers a closely guarded secret.\n\nThe danger of unleashing such powers once again terrifies me. If done incorrectly, the warding spell could consume us all well before the arrival of Baal's army. However, I have studied the rites, and I am confidant I can cast the warding correctly with the Council's help. The ward will bar passage to any spawn of Hell-even Baal himself. I intend to place it around the entirety of Harrogath.\n\nCasting the spell in this fashion requires that all seven Elders venture outside the protective walls of our city. The danger is great... We may all be killed. However, I see no alternative. I go now to take this matter before the assembled Council of Elders.\n\nCompline\n\nMy meeting with the Elders was as trying as I suspected it would be. They vehemently disagreed with my plan. Nihlathak argued that there must be another way to stop Baal's assault, but neither he nor the others could offer a real alternative. In time, five of the Elders came to see that my plan was the only way. Regrettably, Qual-Kehk remained unconvinced. \n\nThough Nihlathak reluctantly agreed to participate in the spell, he refused to help convince Qual-Kehk of my plan's merit. I must admit I was intimidated by Nihlathak-even though I am older then he and of higher standing within the council. When I pressed Qual-Kehk to support my plan, he bristled with anger. I cannot recall ever seeing him so upset-not even when his finest protégé left in search of adventure, never to return. But I stood firm in my resolve and finally convinced him that this alone could ensure the safety of Harrogath. Even now, he readies his best men to guard us while we cast the Druid ward. \n\nAs I write this, I can hear the screams of the dying in the distance...calling to us...mocking us. But before I cast what may be my final spell...I must see our beloved Anya one last time.\n\nAust\n\nElder of harrogath\n\n7th Day of Montaht\n\n1265 Anno Kehjistani"

I once believed in something greater than myself; I believed that the faithful would be rewarded and the evil would be punished.\n\nI believed the Prophecies of the Final Day to be mere superstitions- and that even if they had any credence at all, as our ancestors believed, the events they spoke of would never come to fruition in our time.\n\nI was a fool.\n\nThe gods have not revealed their divine plan to me, nor have they blessed me with their countenance. But I am certain of one terrible fact-At long last, the prophecies have begun to fulfill themselves.\n\nFirst, there was Tristram...\n\nDiablo, the Lord of Terror, cast his shadow over the quiet hamlet and set his demonic minions loose across the countryside. A number of valiant heros rose up to challenge Diablo's wrath and hunted the demon lord into the bowels of the earth itself. Only by the grace of the Light did they vanquish Diablo's mortal host and put an end to his nefarious schemes.\n\nIt seemed that the Lord of Terror had been defeated, and my heart took solace in this affirmation of my faith...but alas, the nightmare was only beginning.\n\nSomehow, Diablo's terrible spirit survived and took root within the very hero who struck him down. Wearing the guise of the mysterious Wanderer, Diablo set off to free his brothers, Baal and Mephisto, from their imprisonment in the East. \n\nJust as before, a new band of heros arose to put a halt to Diablo's dark quest. Though the Lord of Terror succeeded in freeing his brothers from bondage, their reunion would be short-lived. The mortal heroes managed to vanquish Mephisto and even hunted Diablo into the depths of hell. Only Baal, the lord of Destruction, was left unaccounted for...\n\nOnce again, it seemed that justice had been served. Blind as I was, I clung to the path of the righteous- believing that perhaps, finally, all was well...that the nightmare had given way to a dream of peace.\n\nBut the plague of evil persists, and I...grow weary.\n\nFor now, the nightmare has started once again.\n\nBaal has resurfaced, and behind him marches the vast Army of Destruction. He has gathered a legion of demons that revel and mayhem and wanton chaos-and they are headed right towards us...right towards the holy mountain our ancestors swore to protect. It is obvious that Baal comes to assail Arreat, seeking the Heart of the World. And my faith, once unwavering, is now shaken to the very core.\n\nThe prophecies that spoke of this day have at last come true. Doom has come to this world. \n\nAs I have said, my brothers, I grow weary. I have no doubt that Evil exists. I have seen it with my own eyes; I have seen its cruelty. But is it not cruel for the gods to give hope, only to dash that hope again and again.\n\nIn my youth, I tried as best I could to prepare for such an event. It was, at one time, the very reason for my existence. But now that the moment is at hand, I feel old. I feel afraid. I feel that I have lost my strength.\n\nI confess that my faith no longer guides my path. It is with a heavy heart that I take my leave of you, my brothers. I would say that I will pray for you, but I fear my prayers would fall on deaf ears.\n\nMay you someday find the truth, and may that truth finally give you freedom.\n\nYours in sorrow, \n\nOrd Rekar\n\nElder of Harrogath"

            "0": "Excerpt from the journel of the Vizjerei mage, Jor Tiraj: Acolyte of the Horadrim\n\nOn the fifty-eighth day of our campaign, we caught up with Baal near the ancient port city of Lut Gholein. We had tracked the great Lord of Destruction all the way from the lands of Kehjistan some months before. Our leader, Tal Rasha, believed that Baal was headed north, towards the wintry lands of Scosglen, but for some reason the demon chose to forfeit his lead and take refuge within the sandblasted city.\n\nWishing to avoid a confrontation where innocents might be hurt, Tal Rasha ordered to stay our attack until Baal had left the city walls. We waited and watched for three days before the treacherous creature emerged from Lut Gholein. Heading north as Tal Rasha predicted, Baal set off once more. Before he had traveled more than a few miles into the surrounding desert, we were on him. With the strongest spells we could muster, we battered the great Lord of Destruction and forced him to give ground before us.\n\nThe enraged demon let loose the full fury of his powers. The earth itself exploded under our feet, swallowing many of our brethren. Fire leapt up from the split rock and burned many more. Destruction spiraled around us in every conceivable form, but we had traveled too far to be stopped just then. Weakened by his exertions, Baal let loose one final strike against Tal Rasha; yet, thankfully, the mage was left relatively unhurt. Unfortunately, the sacred Soulstone that he had been given by the Archangel Tyrael was shattered into several small pieces. Reeling in panic, we pressed our attack and succeeded in temporarily subduing the raging demon.\n\nKnowing that the Soulstone's broken shards would not be enough to contain Baal's powerful essence, Tal Rasha quickly devised a reckless plan to contain the demon forever. With a feverish light in his eyes, he coldly walked over to Baal's writhing form and slit the creature's throat. As Baal's spirit fled the dying body, Tal Rasha chose the largest of the Soulstone's shards and jammed it into the open wound. Just as with Mephisto, Baal's spirit was sucked into the golden shard's vacuous recesses and trapped. The shard pulsed and hummed as though unable to hold it's contents in check. Though we questioned his judgment, Tal Rasha seemed confident that the shard would hold Baal off until our task was complete.\n\nAt this moment, the Archangel Tyrael appeared and held Tal Rasha in his penetrating gaze. The angel's shimmering visage was beautiful beyond comprehension, and I distinctly remember him whispering to Tal Rasha, Your sacrifice will be long remembered, noble mage.\" With the golden shard in hand, Tyrael led us to a series of secret caves buried deep beneath the burning desert sands. There we found seven ancient tombs built by some long forgotten people. Our grim procession stopped at the last enormous vault, and Tyrael bade us to begin to constructing a binding stone at the chamber's center. It was the only then that I realized what he and Tal Rasha had in mind...\n\nWe etched powerful runes of containment upon the binding stone and used our magics to craft unbreakable chains from the chamber's walls. Once preparations were completed, Tal Rasha ordered that he be shackled and bound to the stone. To our horror, Tyrael walked forward and brandished the glowing shard before him. Before any of us could react, the Archangel drove the shard into Tal Rasha;s bare chest. Golden fire blazed from Tal Rasha's eyes as the Lord of Destruction flooded into his writhing body. We gaped in awe as the realization of what had transpired took root in our minds. Tal Rasha had made the ultimate sacrifice: He would remain chained forever, cursed to wrestle with Baal's foul spirit until the end of time. "

            "0": "An excerpt from the manuscripts of Deckard Cain: Last of the Horadrim \n\nRegrettably, I was the only man in Tristram who knew about the Soulstone buried beneath the ancient Monastery. As the last descendant of the Horadrim, I alone knew the truth about what the crimson stone held locked within it. Perhaps if I'd told them all about it, our quite little village would have been spared. Perhaps this horrible chain of events might never have come to pass. \n\nIn truth, I suspect that it was the Archbishop Lazarus who first fell prey to the Soulstone's power, He had been sent from Kurast as an ambassador of the Zakarum Church. Cloaked in the Light as he was, no one even suspected the treachery he proved capable of. Apparently, it was he who discovered the crimson stone within the labyrinth under the Monastery...and shattered it. \n\nWhether it was madness or some insidious agenda that drove him, Lazarus released upon us an unspeakable horror. Diablo, the Lord of Terror, who was imprisoned within the Soulstone by my ancestors, was set loose upon the world once again. Somehow, Diablo used his hell-borne powers to transform the dark labyrinth into a gateway that led straight into the gaping maw of Hell itself. His murderous servants took up residence within it and awaited anyone foolish enough to plumb its darkened recesses. Our own noble sovereign, King Leoric, fell under Diablo's sway and spiraled down into the depth of madness and fear. As our maddened King gripped the land in an iron fist, his only son, Prince Albrecht, was kidnapped by Lazarus and spirited away into the ruined Monastery. We watched as the dark things under the earth began to venture into our village, terrorizing all who had chosen to remain. Those were dark days for all of us... \n\nBy day we worked our farmlands as we always had, trying in vain to ignore the growing sense of terror, which emanated from the ruined Monastery. By night, we huddled with our families and prayed for the light of dawn to come. After what seemed like an eternity, deliverance finally made his appearance. \n\nA steady stream of heroes and adventurers from all across the know world came to investigate the rumors they'd heard about the growing evil in Tristram. Some came seeking fortune and glory, while others sought to test themselves against the mysterious beasts, which slept beneath the earth. Even Sorcerers from the ancient Vizjerei Mage Clan came to study the evil that had awakened in our land. Though the many adventurers nearly bled our village dry, all our hopes for salvation rode on their shoulders. \nThere was one warrior among them; a quiet, brooding man, who stood out from the rest. Nope of us ever caught his name, or spoke more than a few words with him. Yet he radiated a calm and focus that unnerved even the staunchest of the other would-be heroes. It was this mysterious warrior who fought his way into the deepest recesses of the labyrinth. It was he who finally defeated the Lord of Terror in single combat. \nWhen I close my eyes, I can hear the sounds of Diablo's tortured death-cry echoing in my ears. It rumbled up from the deep earth and shattered the windows of the decrepit Monastery. It may only have been my imagination, but I distinctly remember the sound of a young child screaming in the midst of the anguished roar. The echoes of that cry still torture the few hours of sleep I am able to get. \n\nI still remember the sight of the warrior as he crossed the Monastery's threshold and stepped out into the light of the sun. He looked as if he had walked through Hell himself; and who's to say?... Maybe he had. He has covered in both his own blood and that of his enemies. Yet strangely enough, my eye was drawn to the strange wound on his forehead. It looked as if he had somehow gouged himself above his eyes, yet the wound appeared to have already healed. I never did get a chance to question him about it. \n\nSuffice to say, we believed that our village had been saved, and we bequeathed all manner of rewards upon our nameless hero. Despite he praises and accolades given him, he slipped further and further into a deep, brooding depression. I could only imagine the mind-numbing horrors he had seen beneath the dark earth. I could only speculate as to how they had affected his heart and mind. \n\nHe stayed among us for a time. He had no family and nowhere else to go, so it seemed logical that he should be welcomed in Tristram. Though he was cordial to those who approached him, he usually kept to himself and seldom came out from the house that we had given him. Ogden suggested that we throw a celebration in the hope that the strong drink and good company would snap him out of his dark mood. We were mistaken. At some point during the celebration he slipped away and left us none the wiser. Later in the evening I paid a visit to his home. Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw there. \n\nThe nameless man sat alone in his own entryway, muttering to himself in different languages, many of which had not been used in centuries. He had donned a dark traveling cloak, and its deep hood hung low over his face. When he turned toward me, the firelight glinted off his tortured features, revealing the distorted visage of a man who was no longer himself. His eyes shone with a crimson haze and an eerie red light pulsed from the depths of the hood. The wound on his forehead had opened... And I though I saw... No, it probably was just a trick of the light playing with an old man's overactive imagination. \n\nI asked him if he was well, yet he just continued to ramble on. I was thoroughly unnerved by the whole scene and had made up my mind to leave him in the order to bring help, when suddenly he seemed to snap to attention and spoke with an icy voice that filled my heart with a paralyzing dread. \"The time has come to leave this place. My brothers await me in the east. Their chains will bind no longer.\" I had no idea what he was talking about. We were all under the impression that he had no family. Yet, seeing that he had come back to his sense, I decided to take my leave and let him rest. In fact, at that moment, I was quite terrified by him and wished to escape his burning gaze. It was the last time I ever saw him. \n\nOur nameless hero left Tristram early the next morning. In secrecy he set off towards the eastern pass with only a pack of provisions and his sturdy sword. I can only guess at what he went searching for. Shortly after his departure, our worst nightmares came true. The demonic servants of Hell returned to Tristram. \n\nAs of this writing, I am the only survivor left. I have evaded the foul beasts for many nights, but I know that my time is running short. Why they've returned and why they butchered so many innocents, I'll never know. All that I am sure of is that their arrival is somehow tied with the nameless one's departure... I have written all of this down in the hope that someone will find these passages and attempt to right what transpired here. I expect that my life will end soon, but perhaps these writings will help to prevent this tragedy from befalling other villages; other lands. I will remain here until either help arrives, or the creatures finally come for me. Heaven help me. Even after al that has happened, I cannot bring myself to abandon this dismal place. \nSeek out the nameless Wanderer. Find out what he is searching for. I fear that Tristram is only the first of many villages to be consumed by the evil he sought to combat. "

For the past few months, I have witnessed a certain darkening of your spirits that I can hardly account for. You and your brethren are First amongst the Chosen of the Light.
